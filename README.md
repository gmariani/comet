# Comet
Comet is a Flash-based chat application. It is a stand-alone application and does not require a server application in order to function. This was made becuase a friend of ours worked at a company that didn't allow any IM programs and we were too cheap to setup a server.

# Features
- Muli-user chat without backend server
- Easy to setup
- Secure login
